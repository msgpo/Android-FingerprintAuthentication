# Android-FingerprintAuthentication

This is an android application that has 2 authentication method. The first one username-password, the second one is fingerprint authentication. This project is developed as the first project of the BLG 439E course in ITU 2017-2018 Fall.

You can find the document of the project as named "Report.pdf" file. Also, there is a presentation file named "Present.pptx" for the project. I added references that I used for the project in the presentation file.
